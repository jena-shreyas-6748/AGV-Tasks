# AGV-Tasks
This repository contains the different tasks that I carried out as part of the Task Round of selections for the Autonomous Vehicle Group (AGV), a Research group 
aimed at building fully-autonomous self-driving cars.

There were a total of 5 tasks, and I managed to complete 3 of them - Tasks 1, 3 and 5, while I made partial progress in Task 2. 
A detailed explanation of each task is provided in the README files for the respective tasks.

Please feel free to suggest any suitable modifications or alternative approaches by which these tasks could be attempted.
Hope you like it :)
