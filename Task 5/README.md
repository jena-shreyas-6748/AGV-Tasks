This task involved the implementation of Pose Estimation using Aruco tags.

The candidate was required to calibrate a device camera (like a laptop webcam) using a set of images of a printed Aruco tag clicked in different orientations.
Calibration of the device camera would give the camera parameters like camera matrix and distortion coefficients.
Then the calibrated camera would be used to estimate the orientation of the printed Aruco tag from real-time video streaming.

Hope you find it interesting!
