#Task 1

This task involved a standard application of the Dijkstra and A* shortest path-finding algorithms.

The candidate was required to implement both the algorithms to find the shortest path between two given source and destination points in a 100 * 100 image.
This had to be implemented using Manhattan, Euclidean and Diagonal distances and using both admissible and non-admissible heuristics.

Hope you find it useful!
