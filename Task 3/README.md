This task involved the implementation of a Kalman filter.

The candidate was required to implement a Kalman filter from scratch and perform accurate estimation of motion parameters of a moving robot using
motion data obtained from the robot's sensors. The robot's motion data was provided in the from of a .txt file, and extensive parameter tuning of the Kalman filter
was needed to obtain really accurate predictions.

Hope you find it useful!
